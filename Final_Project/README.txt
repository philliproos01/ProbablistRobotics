All files must be in the same file to run

For Python Simulation, from top directory, run informed_rrt_star.py using: python -m {top}.InformedRRTStar.informed_rrt_star

OR 

rrt_star.py using: python -m {top}.RRTStar.rrt_star

Output will be an animation of the algorithm running with defined environment parameters (some previous test cases are commented out), upon completion and exit, the solved path configurations given as a list of x,y coordinates.
