In order to run the file you must have the Camera Vision, machine learning, and image processing tool-box. 
This can be installed as a MATLAB add-on which is usually prompted on startup.
Other than that, this file runs as any MATLAB file would. Once you run the file the simulation should run by itself- please
let the program run up to 5 minutes as it may take longer on some computers. If any kind of error occurs on the first start if the program,
re-run and it should work.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For ease of use, I have removed the recommended "press enter in between time steps to advance the simulation" as it makes running the simulation a lot slower. If you wish to re-add this feature simply press control + F in matlab and uncomment the line "w = waitforbuttonpress;"
